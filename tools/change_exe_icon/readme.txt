Here is to use "Resource Hacker" to replace icon of executables.

There are two recommanded approaches:

1. You may modify Python script or operate in Python cmdline to do the thing. The file can be "change.py".

2. You may run the scripts in "rh_scripts" directory to apply preset tasks. You may run in cmdline with:
`ResourceHacker.exe -script [ScriptFile]`

Resource Hacker is here available: https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/#download
You have to download the software yourself. I can provide the software for the reason of distribution restrictions.
